# _Cardiac_Problem_Detection_
## This Project is aimed to detect any probable Cardiac Diseases that a person is suffering or may have a chance to suffer in the future.
#### This project takes input from the user like:-
1.Age\
2.Gender\
3.Height\
4.Weight\
5.Diastollic Preassure\
6.Systolic Preassure\
7.Glucose Level in the range of (1,2,3)\
8.Smoking (Yes or No)\
9.Alchohol (Yes or No)\
10.Lifestyle (active or not)\
and tries to output weather the person is having any chances of getting a cardiac Disease.
### The evaluation metric which is taken into account is _Recall_ and _F1_ _Score_,
### because if we consider the _medical field_ , we would want as few FN (False Negetives) as possible and therefore ensuring that the patients who are having any disease are not sent back without being treated.
